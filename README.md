# GitPwny
Scan Git repositories and profiles for PHP functions that look vulnerable and saves them for further analysis

Nothing is currently here because I'm still in the process of moving everything over from my Forgejo instance to GitHub. Please check back later and I may have uploaded the project files here.\
If I haven't, I'm either dead, arrested or (most likely) collapsed in the middle of a sidewalk after consuming a litre of rakija xD
